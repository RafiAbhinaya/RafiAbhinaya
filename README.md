### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rafi, a passionate final-year student with a deep interest in data science and data analytics. I hold certifications in Python, SQL, and Data Analysis and have hands-on experience
in data wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, and visualization. 

Currently, I'm diving deeper into the world of Machine Learning through the **Bangkit Academy** by Google, GoTo, and Traveloka. 
I'm always eager to learn new stuffs and improve my skills to excel in this field.

Feel free to explore my repositories and connect with me if you'd like to collaborate or discuss anything!
